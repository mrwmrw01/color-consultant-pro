## 🎯 What Was Deployed

**Feature:** Draggable and floating zoom controls for photo annotation

**Problem Solved:**
- Zoom controls were fixed in top-right corner
- Would block annotations when working on right side of images
- No way to move controls out of the way

**Solution:**
- Created draggable zoom control panel
- Users can click and drag to move anywhere
- Position persists across sessions (localStorage)
- Stays within canvas bounds

## 💡 How to Use (User Instructions)

1. **Navigate to a project** and open a photo for annotation
2. **Find the zoom controls** - floating panel with grip handle
3. **Click the grip handle** (top of panel, has grip icon)
4. **Drag to desired position** - works anywhere on canvas
5. **Release** - position automatically saved
6. **Use zoom features** - buttons work same as before

**Note:** Position is saved per browser, so each device/browser can have its own preferred position.
